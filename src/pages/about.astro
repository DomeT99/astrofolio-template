	<p>Hi, I'm Domenico Tenace — a passionate software developer from Italy with a strong focus on modern web technologies and open source. I specialize in JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue.js, and Astro, and enjoy building clean, accessible, and high-performance web applications.</p>

	<p>Outside of coding, I write technical articles, contribute to open source projects, and share development resources to help others grow in the tech community. I believe in continuous learning, collaboration, and the power of good documentation.</p>

	<p>Let’s build something great together.</p>
